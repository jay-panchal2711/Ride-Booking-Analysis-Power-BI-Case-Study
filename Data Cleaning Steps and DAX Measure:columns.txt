# Data Cleaning & Transformation Steps (Power Query)

Removed blank, null, duplicate, and error rows.

2. Trimmed extra spaces from all text fields.

3. Standardized categorical values:
   - Vehicle types (Auto, Mini, Sedan, Prime, XL, etc.)
   - Booking status (Completed, Cancelled, Incomplete)
   - Payment modes (Cash, Wallet, UPI, Card)

4. Created derived columns:
   - DateTime = [Date] + [Time]
   - DayOfWeek = WEEKDAY([DateTime],1) → Monday–Sunday
   - HourOfDay = HOUR([DateTime])

5. Converted ride flags into binary (0/1):
   - Cancellation by Driver
   - Cancellation by Customer
   - Ride Completed

6. Replaced inconsistent cancellation reasons with standardized labels:
   - Wrong Address → Address Issue
   - Customer Not Ready → Customer Delay
   - Driver No Show → Driver Issue

7. Removed outliers:
   - Distance > 150 km flagged as invalid
   - Booking Value > ₹10,000 flagged as invalid

8. Ensured data types:
   - Date → Date
   - Time → Time
   - Distance → Decimal
   - Booking Value → Currency
   - Ratings → Decimal (1–5 scale)

# DAX Measures for Ride Booking Analysis

1. Total Rides
   TotalRides = COUNTROWS('Rides')

2. Completed Rides
   CompletedRides = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Rides'), 'Rides'[Status] = "Completed")

3. Cancelled Rides
   CancelledRides = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Rides'), 'Rides'[Status] = "Cancelled")

4. Avg Ride Distance
   AvgDistance = AVERAGE('Rides'[Distance])

5. Avg Booking Value
   AvgBookingValue = AVERAGE('Rides'[BookingValue])

6. Avg Customer Rating
   AvgCustomerRating = AVERAGE('Rides'[CustomerRating])

7. Peak Hourly Demand
   PeakHour = SUMMARIZE(
       'Rides',
       'Rides'[HourOfDay],
       "RideCount", COUNTROWS('Rides')
   )

8. Customer Cancellation Rate
   CustCancelRate = 
     DIVIDE(
       CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Rides'), 'Rides'[CancelledBy] = "Customer"),
       [TotalRides],
       0
     )

9. Driver Cancellation Rate
   DriverCancelRate = 
     DIVIDE(
       CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Rides'), 'Rides'[CancelledBy] = "Driver"),
       [TotalRides],
       0
     )

10. Revenue
    TotalRevenue = SUM('Rides'[BookingValue])

11. Total Cancellations 
    TotalCancellations= SUM('Table'[Cancelled by Cuetomer]) + SUM('Table'[Cancelled by Driver])

12. Weekdays
    DayName = FORMAT('Table'[DateTime], "dddd")

13. Hours
    HourOfDay = HOUR('Table'[DateTime])

Steps to Create Rating Bins

In Data View, select your Customer Rating column.

Go to Modeling → New group.

In the pop-up:

Group type → Bin

Bin size → for ratings (which are usually 1–5 scale), you can choose:

1 → bins will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (discrete categories)

0.5 → bins will be 1.0–1.5, 1.5–2.0, … (more detailed)

This creates a new column: Customer Rating (bin)
